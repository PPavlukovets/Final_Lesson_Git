## Final_Lesson_Git 

---

### Description:

This repo was created to demonstrate my knowledge of using GitHub. It contains several files, including the Readme file. In the process of creating this repo I used the following commands:

```
1. git init
2. git add
3. git status
4. git commit
5. git push
```

Summing up, I can say that I got the skills to create my own repo and the practice of using the Git console. For me it wasn't difficult, because these knowledge and skills were basic.

When you open this file, the line appears:

```
Hello, Clementine!
``` 
As you can see, this is a really simple program.
